# CSPE Assignments 2020/2021
This repository contains the solutions to the assignments of the course Computer Systems Performance Evaluation for the year 2020/2021.

This set of assignments was mostly done in python, in particular through Jupyter Notebooks.

All assignments contain a solution provided by the professor in the form of a pdf named "results.pdf".
If the results in these documents differ from the one obtained, it's due to unpredictable causes.

When necessary, all the necessary files needed to verify the results are given (images/jmva files/jmt reports).

Two assignments (namely assignment 2 and 3) are written in matlab.

Thanks to Jupyter notebooks, each assignment should be self explanatory.

## How to view the assignments
To view the jupyter notebooks you can either navigate the directories in github (in which case you won't be able to execute the assignments) or clone the repository and use your instance of jupyter to view and execute them.

To install jupyter notebooks you can use `pip`:

```
pip install --user notebook
```

To view and execute the matlab assignments (namely assignment 2 and assignment 3) you need to download their files and execute them on you copy of matlab.
